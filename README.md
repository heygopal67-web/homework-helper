hey, this is SolveBuddy :)

SolveBuddy is a simple, single-page web app that helps students understand homework questions. You can take a photo, upload an image, or type a question. The app runs OCR on images, asks an AI tutor for step-by-step guidance, and presents clear, readable steps.

### What it does
- Take a photo or upload an image of a question and extract text
- Get step-by-step explanations in Basic or Detailed mode
- Read aloud the steps
- Keep a local history of explained questions
- Sketch and highlight on screen
- Toggle light/dark theme and change the font

### Get started
1. Download or clone this project.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.

No build step or server is required.

### How to use
- Use Take Photo or Upload Photo to send a question image. A preview appears before processing.

- Choose Basic or Detailed mode from the top toggle.

- Use Sketch to draw highlights and Done to close.

### Notes
